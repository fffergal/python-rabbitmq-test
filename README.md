A little python scraping and RabbitMQ test
==========================================

Prompted by Skyscanner's data acquisition job details.

How to use
----------

1. Start a RabbitMQ server on locahost, probably `rabbitmq-server` 
   with the right priveledges.
2. `./consumer.py` will keep running.
3. `./scraper.py` in another console.
4. Check the consumer.py console for messsages!
